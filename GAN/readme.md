### CVPR22
https://github.com/amusi/CVPR2022-Papers-with-Code#gan.  

found 2 might be helpful. to check.   
[styleGAN-v](https://universome.github.io/stylegan-v)  
in this paper, apparently that 3D consistency have some space for improving.
"design continuous motion representations through the lens of positional embeddings." what does this mean. can this be utilized in our thoughts?  
CHECK IN DETAIL !

[style transformer](https://github.com/sapphire497/style-transformer).  


#### GAN in CVPR22
https://www.zhihu.com/people/ke-zhan-shen

----------------------

1. skip some very beginning papers of GAN.


--------------------

before dive into GAN, learn about some basic and important concepts  
[some concepts before start](https://towardsdatascience.com/keywords-to-know-before-you-start-reading-papers-on-gans-8a08a665b40c).  
[latent space](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-latent-space-in-machine-learning-de5a7c687d8d).  

---------------------

### paper
mainly about 2D, search for 3D style transfer, deform?  
[reviews on google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=Neural+Style+Transfer%3A+A+Review&btnG=)

#### AdaIN
[code pytorch](https://github.com/naoto0804/pytorch-AdaIN). in lambda, using gans2 conda env.  
some explain  [1](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/401977002) [2](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/158657861).  
there are some following works to fix its problem.  [3](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/475949392).  
AdaIN is used in a paper that combines NeRF. for stylization. CVPR22.  

[to read] what about shape style? not just color. [a work](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/119048167)    


---------------------

#### styleGAN1 and styleGAN2. even styleGAN3? cvpr22.  
[styleGAN1 and styleGAN2](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/263554045).

#### jojoGAN
intersting results on face.

### dataset
style images.  [wikiarts](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/painter-by-numbers/data)

---------------------

### some papers might be aboout 3D shape[haven't check]
