CGDA: computer-generated drawing approximation
---

### backgroud  
I need to do some research on sketch and drawing stuff.  
I begin with a paper given by Matsui-sensei:  
[Tracing Versus Freehand for Evaluating Computer-Generated Drawings]  
In 4.4.1 of this paper, I found some methods to generate sketches or lines.

you can download some 3D models [here](https://gfx.cs.princeton.edu/proj/sugcon/models/), which are the input of rtsc(a software).
